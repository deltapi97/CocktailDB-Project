A Java application that retrieves cocktail list from a public cocktail database and displays them using a Swing GUI. 
Users can add their favorite cocktails and save them to a .json file for future reference.

This application was created to practice several design patterns:

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern: To separate the application's concerns.
- DAO (Data Access Object) pattern: For abstracting and encapsulating all access to the data source.
- Repository pattern: To manage collections of domain objects.
- Factory pattern: For creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
- Singleton pattern: To ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
